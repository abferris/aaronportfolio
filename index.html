							<p>Hi, My name is Aaron Ferris. I am a junior web developer with a background in engineering, leadership and customer service. I grew up in Seattle near the University of Washington. In first grade, my best friend said he wanted to be an engineer, and I decided to explore the world of knowledge as well. Ever since then, I've loved mental challenges and solving them, however I have always been primarily a social butterfly.</p>
							<p>For my higher education, I attended University of Portland's Donald P. Shiley School of Engineering, and completed a BSME. While working on my final project, I felt isolated from people and instead of pursuing a career with my degree I decided to move to something more people oriented, which eventually landed me a job in retail while working in the community coaching Ultimate Frisbee.</p>		 
							<p>While I did well and progressed to a manager, but I  never felt completely challenged enough. In the natural progression of that career, I only saw myself becoming more miserable as a store manager solely concerned with the store’s sales, and decided to move to something else.</p>		 
							<p>My brother had been bothering me to try coding for at least a year and a half, and after talking with people, I decided it was right for me. The challenge and the methodical approach was appealing to  me, but I was also pleasantly surprised by how closely developers work together in teams</p>		.
							<p>My excellence at isolating  and understanding a problem from engineering and my experience in retail, understanding the customer’s needs, building and working with a team has placed me in an excellent place not only to be excited and challenged, but to also thrive in an ever changing environment.</p>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/ultimategang.jpg" alt="Summer Camp ultimate frisbee tournament held by Kat Overton 2014" /></a>

							<p>I am a lover of all things science, as long as you do not make me do biochemistry. My personal interests are varied. I love music can play the piano. I love to go to karaoke bars and sing (go-to artist being Prince). I am a large consumer in science fiction and fantasy. Reading has been my original love, and has always sparked my imagination, fueling ideas for the rest of my life. I enjoy going out to theaters, and love to watch films not simply for watching it but studying it in its ideologys, appeal to audience, and cool decisions that creators make. When I can, I play Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, and occasionally will run a campaign when I have the time. I also love sports, and in particular the rising star of Ultiamate frisbee. I have been a competitive athlete, a casual athlete, and a coach for Middle School.</p>
